# Medopad - Frontend Challenge

## The Task

We would like you to create a simple react app that allows a doctor to visualise and a monitor patient's heart rate. This app should take data from an existing backend (provided in the repo), and display it to the doctor in a meaningful way.

## What you'll need

1. You'll need `nodejs` installed
2. Clone this repo
3. `npm install`

## Instructions

1.  Run the server with `node app.js` You'll see the heart rate data at `localhost:3000/heartrate`
2. Create a new React app in your repo
3. Fetch data from the endpoint `localhost:3000/heartrate`
4.  Visualise the data in your React app! This should meet the following criteria, but the way you do this is up to you..
    1.  It should have a chart
    2. You should be able to update the chart by filtering in a useful way(s)
    3.  The data should also be shown in a table or a list
5. When finished, please email your code back to us (don't fork the repo, as then others will be able to see your solution). 

## The requirements

-   The app fetches data from our API and displays it in the UI
-   The app is built with React. Beyond this, feel free to use any libraries, frameworks or tools that you like.
-   Your app is easy to install and run locally
-   It's beautiful and looks great at all screen sizes. 

## For extra bonus points you could...

These aren't required for this challenge, just some ideas for nice-to-haves :).

-   Add unit tests and/or snapshot tests
-   Add flow for static typechecking
-   Dockerize the app
-   Deploy the app somewhere
-   Show an offline message if you lose browser connectivity
